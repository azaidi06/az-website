<div class="about-intro">
I'm a Product Leader and Applied AI Engineer with a passion for building data-driven products that solve real problems. With experience spanning startups and enterprise environments, I specialize in bridging the gap between cutting-edge technical solutions and strategic product vision. I believe the best products emerge when deep technical understanding meets genuine user empathy.
</div>

## What I Do

I work at the intersection of product strategy and hands-on engineering. Whether it's defining a product roadmap, architecting an ML pipeline, or diving into code to prototype a new feature, I'm comfortable operating across the full stack of product development. My approach combines rigorous data analysis with iterative experimentation to build products that users love.

## Background

My journey in tech has taken me through diverse roles where I've consistently focused on using data and technology to drive impact. I've led product initiatives from conception to launch, built ML systems processing millions of data points, and mentored teams on best practices for scalable software development. I'm driven by curiosity and a desire to continuously learn—whether that's exploring the latest advances in AI or understanding a new problem domain.
